                            R-Type Protocols

Preface

    This protocol is the official written protocol of our R-TYPE project.
    There is two different protocols inside the project: the TCP protocol
    (used to connect and insure the connection between the new player and
    the server) and the UDP protocol (used to transmit realtime 
    information about the currently played game). This R-TYPE project is
    a third year project from EPITECH.

1.  Introduction

   The goal of the R-Type project is reproduce the the classic: 
   R-Type game (1987). But, it needs to be a bit refreshed by a online
   multiplayer system.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

2.  R-Type TCP Protocol

    As I explained in the preface, all the client-server communications
    before the game's launch are done by using this R-Type TCP Protocol.

    2a.  Payload

        Every transmission done with the R-Type TCP Protocol MUST
        transmit a payload containing this 3 datas:

            ACTION ACTION_NAME;
            int SIZE;
            void *VALUE;

        Where ACTION_NAME is an element of the ACTION enumeration
        (described below) representing the action to do with the
        payload, SIZE is the size (in bytes) of VALUE, and VALUE is the
        data to be processed.
        The ACTION enumeration:

        enum ACTION {
            CREATE,
            JOIN,
            DISCONNECT,
            START,
            DIRECTION
         };

        As I mentionned before, this enum is a set of action that can be
        request by the client. The action :

        - CREATE : used to create a lobby
        
        - JOIN : used to join a lobby
        
        - DISCONNECT : used to tell the server that the client is
                       leaving
        
        - START : used to tell from the server to client that the game
                  is starting
        
        - DIRECTION : not used in the tcp protocol

        The client have to write ACTION_NAME, SIZE and VALUE in a row.
        These data wil be readen by the server in a row too and thanks
        to the SIZE, the server will know how many bytes he have to
        read.

3.  R-Type UDP Protocol

    Once the game is launched, the client-server communications are
    done by using this R-Type UDP Protocol. The server will send
    frame by frame to all clients.

    3a. Payload

        As the R-TYPE TCP protocol, the R-TYPE UDP protocol contain an
        enum to list the ACTION to be made:

        enum ACTION {
            POSITION,
            OK/KO
        }

        The POSITION is a struct of different data:

        struct POSITION {
            int x,
            int y, 
            std::size_t id
        }

        Where x and y is the position of the element to be display, and 
        the id is used to track every element to display.
